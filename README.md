WatchDog - On the lookout for severe weather
===========

##WatchDog is for all Canadians
**“Knowing what’s coming makes all the difference.”** – WatchDog warns you in **advance** of approaching weather conditions using a new breed of hands-free mobile notification technology. Powered by open Federal Government [data](http://data.gc.ca/data/en/dataset/9ff979c5-a307-4224-bbcf-ecfe5a65e828), the app helps to reduce the likelihood of weather-related road congestion, accidents, injuries and productivity loss due to adverse weather conditions. 

##WatchDog solves a problem
The app aims to prevent incidents such as the 90 vehicle accident on Highway 400 north of Toronto after a snow squall moved through the area on February 27th.
##WatchDog increases productivity
Further underlining the need for WatchDog, recent research from Harvard University has shown that temperature, precipitation and windstorms can have severe impacts on agricultural output, industrial output, labour productivity, energy demand, health, conflict, and economic growth among other outcomes (Dell et al., 2014). In Canada each year road crashes cost the health care system over $10 billion and result in thousands of fatalities (Andrey et al., 2001). These studies on the climate-economy identify the strong linkages between weather and productivity across different locations and using different types of weather.
##WatchDog uses open data
WatchDog uses ambient location, hands-free mobile technology that draws on [open weather feeds] (http://data.gc.ca/data/en/dataset/9ff979c5-a307-4224-bbcf-ecfe5a65e828) coming from Environment Canada that refresh every 10 minutes. In addition, the app uses the Multi-Agency Situational Awareness System (MASAS) National Information eXchange for other emergency alerts. Locations of these features are shown against a basemap created using open [CanVec topographic data](http://data.gc.ca/data/en/dataset?q=canvec&sort=relevance+asc&res_format=SHAPE). WatchDog gathers the live feeds, filters them by user location by digitally “fencing” the specific areas of interest, and alerts users of oncoming severe weather events in their vicinity.

**"No Canadian out on the roads can do without this app!"**

##WatchDog is 'calm' and easy to use
Open the app and receive a warning when you drive towards one of these [weather events](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=8c9fd485a1c24ea2af63c77c23d858d4) OR click the 'Test It' button under 'Settings' and walk 10m away from your current location.
